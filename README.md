# bamclone
A Pygame clone of the old Archimedes game, Bambuzle by Kuldip S Pardesi and published by Arxe Systems.

This was a very addictive little game, based on a few simple concepts, and apparently was quite similar to Log!cal on the Amiga. There doesn't seem to be a lot of information about this out there and only a 2 level demo seems to exist. I have an original copy, but the disk has an error and I have been unable to play it on either an emulator or the original hardware.
